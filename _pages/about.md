I am a research scientist at Apple AI/ML. I finished my Ph.D. in Autonomous Systems at MIT in 2019, advised by [Prof. Sertac Karaman](http://sertac.scripts.mit.edu/web/). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from [HKUST](http://www.ust.hk/) in 2013.

My research interest lies in computer vision, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR.
